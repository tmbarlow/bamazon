# Bamazon

This is a Amazon-like market place desigend in Node.js. We sell all the fun items that most places dont sell. This app will take in orders from customers and deplete from the store's stock. 

Initiatlizing node bamazon.js in the command line brings up the store front. It will ask for the item ID of the item you want to purchase and how many you would like. If we are out of stock or we don't have enough of the product, it will let you know. 

Utiliazes mysql, inquirer, cli-table, and color/safe npm packages.
